### COVID-19 Impact on Video Game Industry: A Data Analysis Project

**Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project that explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the video game industry. The goal of this project is to understand how changes in social behavior influenced by the pandemic correlate with video game usage patterns. By integrating public health data with video game player metrics, this project provides insights into how global crises can affect digital entertainment industries.

**Key Objectives**

- **Correlate Video Game Usage with COVID-19 Case Trends**: Utilize time-series data to analyze the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and video game playing activity. The analysis seeks to identify trends that suggest increased gaming during peaks of the pandemic.
- **Visualize Impact Over Time**: Create visual representations of COVID-19 data alongside gaming data to highlight correlations and trends over the course of the pandemic.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employ statistical methods to validate observations and provide a quantitative basis for the observed trends.
  
**Data Sources**

The analysis utilizes two primary datasets:
1. **COVID-19 Data**: Includes daily case increases, death rates, and other relevant metrics.
2. **Video Game Industry Data**: Features monthly average player counts for popular video games.

**Technologies Used**

- Python: For data manipulation and analysis, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for handling datasets and visualizing results.
- Jupyter Notebooks: To document the analysis process, making it reproducible and easy to follow.

**Findings**

The project provides compelling evidence linking significant changes in video game playing behavior with key phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. These insights can help stakeholders in the video game industry better understand consumer behavior in times of global crises.

**Potential Applications**

This analysis is not only relevant for stakeholders in the video game industry but also provides a framework that can be adapted to study other digital media trends in response to global events.
